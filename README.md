Submitted by: **Sami Chen**

This web app: **Allows users to form their own crew made up of their own custom Crewmates. Users can create a custom crewmate with a unique color, speed, and name. They can edit the crewmate they made, or delete it.**

Time spent: **96** hours spent in total

## Notes

I had trouble figuring out how to navigate and use supabase and CRUD properly, after I got past that, incorporating the routers from last unit made this even more challenging. The aesthetic of the website kind of is lacking because of how much time it took.
